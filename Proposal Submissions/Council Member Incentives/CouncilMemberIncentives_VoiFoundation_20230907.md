# Abstract
This proposal is designed to incentivize active, consistent, and  long-term participation of Voi’s testnet committee members for the duration for Voi’s testnet, which is estimated to last anywhere from 3-6 months. This proposal is also written to incentivize deeper participation among committee members that are motivated to take on additional roles in the proposal review process and in supporting the growth of Voi’s ecosystem.

# Team 
For this proposal, the team will be Voi’s core team, also known as the Foundation. The Foundation exists to ensure Voi’s mission of building a blockchain predominantly owned by the ecosystem and community comes to fruition via Voi’s endowment, where 75% is dedicated to nurturing those adding value to the network. 

# Problem Description 
Currently, most blockchains have an endowment where a minority of stakeholders, such as early investors, employees and builders, hold a vast majority of the network’s value. This is antithetical to the ethos of decentralization and also disincentivizes later participants and projects adding value to the ecosystem. In other words, most networks fail to reward real contributions to the network in proportion to the effort put in by builders and others helping to secure and grow the network. 
The voice of the community is rarely heard because there fails to exist a committee built from the actual community and that therefore has the community’s  best interest at heart. Additionally, for such a committee to exist long-term,  participation and leadership should be incentivized and rewarded.

# Solution Approach 
Our solution is to incentivize members on a per meeting basis in addition to incentivizing the  taking on of additional responsibilities within the committee (ex. Champion role or Reviewer role or development of committee related supporting materials and processes). We propose the following breakdown for rewarding council members: 
- 1 million Voi testnet tokens to be granted to individuals that attend each bi-monthly Voi committee meeting in its entirety AND participate at least once during the meeting. A meeting attended in its entirety means member shows up within 15-min of start-time and does not leave within 15-min of scheduled end time. 
- Additional 1 million for individuals that serve as a “Champion” (or similar role…Reviewer, Endorser etc.). 
- An additional 10 million tokens will be allocated for additional supportive tasks completed by members of the council that contribute to the general operations of the committee and support the council in improving the proposal process and due diligence of projects. This pool of testnet tokens will be distributed commensurate with the time and effort of the task. Such tasks should be agreed upon as being needed by the Foundation and Council prior to development (example of such a task could be the creation of due diligence guidelines to support the review of projects requesting funding).

The rewards would all be earned pro-rata.

# Expected Impact & Outcomes for the Voi Community 
The expected impact is to ensure we have an active, engaged and passionate council by rewardeding them for their time and value. 

This results in a net positive outcome for the community at large given that the council members will be incentivized to act on the best interests of the community.

# Technical Approach
N/A - Non technical proposal

# Define Success
Success would be determined by the successful, timly and effective operation of the council. This could include measuring engagement levels of the council members within meetings and on discord as well as tracking how timely responses are to pending actions required by members of the council. 

# Concerns
It is feasible that individuals will only partake in Voi’s testnet committee with the motivation of securing Voi’s testnet tokens instead of a deeper investedness in the future of the network. We aim to solve this by allowing the committee to vote out any member that fails to attend meetings and/or  truly participate, add value, or serve as a positive contribution to the council at any point in time. 

# Project Longevity 
The goal is that testnet committee incentivisation paired with the committee’s responsibilities succeeds in whittling down the council to a team of 11 committed council members that are truly committed to the future of Voi and the value the council has to play in Voi’s success during testnet and beyond.
