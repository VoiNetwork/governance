We request at least 50% prepayemnt for developers costs.

# Abstract
This grant proposal aims to advance the development and open source implementation of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) with concentrated liquidity. AMMs have emerged as a crucial component of decentralized finance (DeFi), providing efficient and decentralized mechanisms for trading digital assets. However, traditional AMMs suffer from certain limitations, such as inefficient capital utilization and vulnerability to impermanent loss.

Concentrated liquidity models address these issues by allowing liquidity providers (LPs) to concentrate their funds within specific price ranges, thereby enhancing capital efficiency and reducing the risk of impermanent loss. This proposal seeks funding to support research, development, and implementation efforts focused on creating open source algorand AMM smart contract.

By supporting this grant proposal, you will contribute to the advancement of decentralized finance by addressing the limitations of traditional AMMs and enhancing capital efficiency and risk management through the implementation of concentrated liquidity models. This research and development effort will foster innovation, attract liquidity providers, and improve the overall user experience in the rapidly evolving Algorand DeFi ecosystem.

# Team 
Ludovit Scholtz, EverydayAlgonaut - Product owner. Active on Algorand forum, runs a few projects in Algorand ecosystem such as the AWallet, public participation nodes, VoteCoin, Aramid Bridge, Stabilitas, Diatomix. Has been winner in few hackathons, such as Algorand encode hack 2021, EUvsVirus, Swiss blockchain hackathon, Bitcoin bankathon, Encode DAO hack, Algo HackJam, Greenhouse hack III, Mega Ace Hackathon, ...

Ludovit Scholtz will assemble team to develop the AMM with scrum agility.

# Problem Description 
Algorand nor VOI does not have any Concentrated liqudidty AMM. Concentrated liquidity improves capital efficiency and lowers sliperage costs for AMM swapping.

# Solution Approach 
We will build smart contract, full test coverage and frontend application. Everything will be fully open source.

# Expected Impact & Outcomes for the Voi Community 
CL AMM will have great impact on DeFi liquidity as it will have competitive advantage against the evm based solutions. The app will be deployed also on algorand and algorand foundation or community may see this as goodwill of the voi to develop for both ecosystems.

# Define Success
Project developed with high test coverage and deployed to voi.

Great success: TVL greater than other non concentrated liquidity AMMs.

# Concerns
After the project is developed, it would be great to go through auditing process which takes much more resources and time.

Final project has to be determined according to available domains.

# Project Longevity 
We will charge 10% of the LP fees. The project after deploy will have low cost budget to be sustainable from the collected fees.

# Project Length
3 months from the start
