Token Quantity
Given that this activity does not have even a fraction of the technical complexity of the current Bounty Board Listings–each of which have approximately 100m testnet tokens as their reward amounts, I would propose a reward amount of 5,000,000 testnet tokens for this proposal. This would encompass a contractual obligation related to running the entity for 12 months time.

Abstract
As a couple of you know, I just returned to the space after taking almost an entire year away from the space at large. Upon returning I was pleasantly surprised to learn that–although Discord still had an overwhelming popularity with communities–there are notable numbers of individuals who dislike using Discord for community engagement. Many of those in this group have expressed a preference for either Telegram or Reddit. Knowing this to be the case, I believe that it is important to expand the community reach that we have with VOI–optimally starting now as opposed to waiting until mainnet is already upon us. Attacking this now would not only lead to a much larger audience of people, but would also result in having a larger crowd of individuals who are available and willing to help actively build the network / project. It would provide us with a much larger pool of talent, knowledge, skills, education, and willingness to help. Because of this, I am proposing that I be allowed explicit approval to create, and subsequently moderate / manage, an official VOI Reddit and Telegram. Obviously it would be insufficient for me to serve as a moderator on my own, so we will undoubtedly need at least a couple of willing volunteers to serve as moderators. The amount of testnet tokens being requested would be used to not only compensate my effort in creating, designing, organizing, promoting, and running / moderating the social platforms, but also to incentivize the recruitment of supportive moderators (2-4 in total). 

Team
My team is currently made up of a crowd of one–myself. However, as aforementioned, with the incentivization of testnet tokens from this proposal, I believe hiring an additional crew of 2-4 others would be relatively simple. I believe I am best suited for this task as I have served in such a role for more than 4 other blockchain / technology projects in the past. Just since 2019 I have served as a Graph Protocol Testnet Curator & Meme Creator, an Algorand Ambassador (among the original group), as a MantraDAO Ambassador, and as a Community Leader for a since defunct project that I was a part of leadership for. Beyond this experience, I also have a Bachelor of Science degree (2014) in Sociology, making it clear that I have plentiful understanding of social & interpersonal engagement.

Problem Description
The primary problem I aim to address with the establishment of a Reddit subreddit and Telegram channel is the need for a centrally-located platform to foster community engagement, discussion, and dissemination of project-related information. By creating these channels, we would provide a dedicated space for those with a vested interest, or even just a casual interest, to connect, share ideas, seek assistance, and stay updated on project developments. Additionally, these platforms serve as valuable tools for outreach, promotion, and building a strong community around the project, ultimately contributing to its growth and success.

Solution Approach
The following is a full breakdown of the Milestones and Timeframes for the task:
Research and Planning (1 week):
Research target audience demographics and preferences.
Determine subreddit and Telegram channel themes, rules, and guidelines.
Create a content calendar outlining post topics and frequency.
Setup and Design (1 week):
Create subreddit and Telegram channel accounts.
Customize subreddit and Telegram channel settings, including visuals and descriptions.
Set up automoderator and bots for moderation and engagement.
Content Creation (Ongoing):
Develop engaging content tailored to the platform's audience.
Encourage user-generated content and discussions.
Maintain a consistent posting schedule to keep the community active.
Community Engagement (Ongoing):
Respond promptly to user inquiries and feedback.
Foster a positive and inclusive community environment.
Organize regular events, contests, or Q&A sessions to encourage participation.
Growth and Promotion (Ongoing):
Implement strategies to attract new members to the subreddit and Telegram channel.
Collaborate with related communities or influencers for cross-promotion.
Utilize advertising or promotional campaigns if necessary.
Performance Evaluation (Monthly):
Analyze engagement metrics such as subscriber growth, post reach, and user interaction.
Adjust content and strategies based on performance insights.
Report progress to stakeholders and propose any necessary adjustments.

Expected Impact & Outcomes for the Voi Community
As aforementioned, having alternative platforms for community engagement is beneficial in a plethora of ways. Not only does it benefit the individual members by giving them choices for where to seek out information, engage with others, discuss any pain points, and just to gather socially. On top of that, it benefits the project as a whole–as well as all those therein–by resulting in a much larger pool of builders, designers, problem-solvers, promoters, marketers, evangelists, and the like. I think we can all agree that having more unique perspectives involved in a community is, without outliers, always a positive thing, and this is why I believe it is important to offer alternative social channels to Discord & Twitter.

Technical Approach
I was going to be facetious & give you the most technical breakdown of this task as possible, but I decided against wasting your time. You’re welcome (haha).

Define Success
Success is always subjective. However, I think this initiative’s success can be measured by three tangible quantifiers–community growth, community positivity, and future bounty completion rates. I believe that, after a month or two of startup, we can measure how much the VOI community has grown overall by analyzing either the number of VIA / testnet VOI holders, number of VOI testnet wallets, or simply the number of unique members from each platform. Furthermore, community happiness and positivity is an underappreciated data point, and I believe that we can measure that of VOI’s community through ye olde questionnaires, or the like. Lastly, I see that many of the current items on the bounty list have remained untouched for a not-insignificant period of time. Having a larger pool of members in the community would likely lead to a higher likelihood that all future bounties are at least started within a much more slight amount of time. 

Concerns & Risks
My primary concern is not necessarily related to creating the platforms, but rather with being able to run them without the interference of bots, scammers, and spammers. I think this is why it would be imperative to have around-the-clock filters.

Prerequisite
Not that come to mind at the moment.

Project Longevity
I plan to personally dedicate 12 whole months serving as an active moderator / staff member. This will involve my presence online for at least a short period 7 days per week, being proactive in resolving any issues that arise, being energetic, and thinking about ways to reward engagement and interaction within the channels. Beyond this, I think it is imperative that I / we bring on other individuals who can provide a wealth of attention, time, and energy as well.

Project Length
If approved, it would take literal minutes to create & launch both channels. However, I would estimate that creating a high-quality design for them would take approximately one day. This would involve creating an attractive logo / profile picture, an attractive banner, and utilizing pleasant, yet useful, integrations. After completing this, I would want to dedicate one week’s time to promote & share the channels before we could expect there to be much, if any, interaction therein. However, this last part is completely dependent on how efficient the promotion thereof works.

Additional Information
I intended to link some more of my past work. However, it appears that the bulk of my past pseudonymous works have all been removed, deleted, or somehow hidden, and I do not wish to link anything that ties back to my direct identity. However, I will say that I was–for about 6 months–one of the five leadership members of the Graphtronauts & their social platforms / channels. This includes Telegram, Reddit, Twitter, and their official website (specifically helped write the articles shown on the website).
