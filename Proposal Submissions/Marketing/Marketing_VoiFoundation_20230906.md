# Abstract
We propose a strategic marketing and education initiative for Voi aimed at enhancing community engagement and understanding of our blockchain project. This initiative includes educational material creation, building a strong social media presence, and incentivizing Ambassadors.

# Team 
The Voi Foundation overseen by Cody Montalvo

# Problem Description 
Voi, as a new blockchain project, faces the challenge of low community engagement and awareness. Many potential users lack knowledge about Voi's technology and its benefits.

# Solution Approach 
We will allocate tokens to create a variety of educational materials, including YouTube videos, Medium articles, Twitter threads, and Reddit posts. Simultaneously, we'll invest in non-technical bounties for social media engagement. Ambassadors will be incentivized to promote Voi and engage with the community.

# Expected Impact & Outcomes for the Voi Community 
This initiative will empower the Voi community with knowledge and resources, attracting new users and strengthening Voi's position in the blockchain ecosystem.

# Technical Approach
The technical aspect involves creating and sharing educational content and marketing materials. Detailed steps will be outlined in project planning.

# Define Success
Success will be measured by increased community engagement, growth in social media presence, and the number of new users onboarded.

# Concerns
We foresee potential challenges in content quality control and Ambassador management, but we have mitigation strategies in place.

# Project Longevity 
We plan to support the project by continuously updating educational materials and maintaining an active social media presence.

# Project Length
The project is estimated to take 3 to 6 months to complete, considering our existing commitments.
