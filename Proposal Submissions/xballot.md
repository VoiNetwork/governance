# Proposal for Integrating XBallot onto Voi Network

## Abstract

This proposal seeks to integrate XBallot, a revolutionary DAO management platform, onto the Voi Network. The XBallot demo is currently deployed on the Algorand blockchain. XBallot has not launched yet. XBallot is designed to facilitate advanced DAO governance and management. Our goal is to extend XBallot's capabilities to both the Testnet and Mainnet of the Voi Network, thereby expanding our platform's reach and functionality.

## Token Quantity

We propose an allocation of 250M Testnet Voi, with distributions tied to a combination of performance metrics and standard deliverables. The distribution is as follows:

50M for delivering and Open Sourcing XBallot with ARC200 & ARC72
50M for integrating XBallot naming service with a Voi Wallet Provider, DEX & NFT Marketplace.
50M if 150 daily active users average over 1 week
50M if 250 daily active users average over 1 week
50M if 350 daily active users average over 1 week
Total 250M
