# Token Quantity

200M Testnet Voi

# Abstract

This proposal aims to integrate Humble DeFi onto Voi. Humble is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) style DEX that facilitates swapping, pooling, and farming of tokens – currently deployed on Algorand. With this integration, we would make available all our current offerings on Voi Testnet & Mainnet which would include, but not be limited to:

A web app for use on both Testnet & Mainnet of Voi.

- Asset swaps supported (ASA, ARC200)
- Ability for user to connect their wallet (A-wallet and more as integrations occur)
- Token Swap (from, to)
- Liquidity Pools (add, remove, your liquidity breakdown, all liquidity overview, fee collection)
- AMM facilitated via smart contract for all supported assets.
- Assets directly link to block explorer proposed by D13.
- Per block Permissionless Yield Farms (Humble LP currently only)
- Open-source contract code and UI.

# Team

Our team is composed of Crypto Veterans, having launched multiple successful projects. Humble has a proven track record and is already operational with a dedicated user base on Algorand. Core contributors include:

Andrew Kotulak – Head of DeFi – BA in Finance from University of Michigan with a strong history in TradFi and Blockchain. On top of directing Humble, he also runs one of the largest Algorand community groups, responsible for hosting the AlgoFest event and providing consulting services for start-up blockchain companies. He also sits on the Algorand DeFi Advisory Committee.

Nicholas Shellabarger is a Software Developer known for his contributions to various blockchain projects. He is the creator of NFT Jam, Algodrop, ARC200 dApp, and is also a co-founder of ZestBloom. He has been actively building on the Algorand blockchain since June 2021 and has played a pivotal role as the lead web3 engineer at ZestBloom.

Currently, Nicholas is responsible for overseeing the maintenance and implementation of new features for Humble. His expertise extends to smart contract development using Reach and Algokit within the blockchain space.

# Problem Description

Having a platform that allows users to swap and earn yield on their tokens is a fundamental need for having a thriving DeFi ecosystem. Having an AMM with a proven track record is important as reliability and a strong product is crucial for early adoption.

# Solution Approach

Integrate Humbles suite of options onto Voi Testnet & Mainnet. As listed above under *Abstract*, this will bring a variety of tools like swap, pools & permissionless yield farms. This will be entirely open source.

# Expected Impact & Outcomes for the Voi Community

This will kickstart DeFi on Voi and bring a credible project on board in Vois infancy. It will give users a place to swap tokens and earn yield on their liquidity, as well as participate in other community events like the Token Challenge. Humbles multichain approach will help bolster its longevity and bring new users to the Voi ecosystem. With our contracts being open source, we can guarantees Humbles longevity on Voi and that the community will always have access regardless of any team that may or may not support it.

# Technical Approach

Headed by our Lead Developer Nicholas Shellabarger, he will be spearheading Humbles integration working off the basis of our existing code base that’s deployed on Algorand. More info about Humbles code structure can be found here: https://github.com/reach-sh/humble-os 

# Define Success

- Successfully implement the core 8 features as laid out in *Abstract* to both Testnet and Mainnet
- 99.99% uptime for the duration of Testnet

# Concerns

We feel confident in being able to adequately address the milestones set out within an appropriate timeline (ref. Project Length). Our split focus on both Algorand and Voi could be seen as a weakness, however we few this as a strength as both ecosystems overlap greatly and we have been planning this within our development roadmap for over 6 months.

# Project Longevity

We have a runway of a minimum of 12-18 months for core contributors to continue at Humble and with the award of this grant, believe we could greatly extend this. Additionally, we will bring in revenue through LP fees which are planned to be set at a standard of .05% of trades (for protocol) and .25% (for LP providers.) We also place a high importance on open sourcing everything and allowing the community to contribute to the protocol, making it truly timeless.  

# Project Length

Deployment to Testnet within 3 months of approval.

Deployment to Mainnet upon internal approval. Aiming to be launched day 1 of Voi Mainnet.
