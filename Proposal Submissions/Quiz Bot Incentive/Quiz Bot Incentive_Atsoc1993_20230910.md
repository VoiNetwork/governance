Quiz Bot Incentive

Token Quantity
(To be determined based on the consensus of the committee. Ideally enough to run the quiz bot for a predetermined period and a fixed amount as a bounty reward, considering the expected number of users, frequency of quizzes and my efforts put into the bot.)

Abstract
Introduction of an interactive incentive, "Voi Buddy," a quiz bot for the Voi Discord channel. It aims to engage the community, promote Voi knowledge, and disburse testnet Voi tokens to participants.

Team
A solo developer with experience in creating and managing bots for Discord, especially those that integrate with blockchain technologies. My previous work includes bots for Foodie City since August 2022.

Problem Description
There's a lack of interactive incentives to engage the community and promote the understanding of Voi and related tech in the Discord.

Solution Approach
Introduce "Voi Buddy," a quiz bot on Discord. It presents Voi-related multiple choice questions and rewards correct answers with testnet Voi tokens.

Expected Impact & Outcomes for the Voi Community
Increased community engagement, better understanding of Voi and its associated technologies, and an interactive way to earn testnet Voi.

Technical Approach
Utilize Discord bot programming.
Integrate the bot with Voi's blockchain to disburse tokens.
Implement a cooldown mechanism to prevent spamming and ensure fair token distribution.
Secure user data by linking the Discord ID with the Voi participation address.
High user engagement in the quiz, increased knowledge of Voi among community members, and positive feedback regarding the interactive token earning process.

Concerns
Ensuring the questions remain relevant and up-to-date.
Monitoring and managing token disbursement to prevent depletion and/or overspending of funds.
Plan to keep updating the bot with new questions and technical upgrades. If successful, consider integrating the bot with mainnet Voi compatibility.
**One-click node set-ups may not currently have the option to redeem their full participation node address to register for the bot.

Project Length
Immediate deployment for testing with committee members. If approved, can be fully functional and launched at request assuming minor adjustments at committee's preference.

Additional Information
For any committee members wishing to test the bot, please contact me directly for the discord details. I emphasize that my primary project will potentially integrate Voi compatibility on the mainnet in the future.

Thank you again for considering this proposal. I believe "Voi Buddy" can significantly enhance our community's engagement and understanding of Voi.
