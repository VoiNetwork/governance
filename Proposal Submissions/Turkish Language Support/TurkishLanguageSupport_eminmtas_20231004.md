# **Turkish Language Support**

# Abstract
I recently found that many of the Voi Network's node runners are from Turkey and they may want to see the docs in Turkish. So, I want to translate all the docs in [voi-docs repository](https://github.com/VoiNetwork/voi-docs) to Turkish language.

# Problem Description 
I believe that the Voi Network documentation should not only be in English but also translated into other languages to make it more decentralized. Therefore, I want to take the first step and contribute by translating these documents into Turkish and contributing to the community.

# Solution Approach 
I will fork the **[voi-docs](https://github.com/VoiNetwork/voi-docs)** repository and make a copy of **testnet** folder and rename it to **testnet_TR**. I will translate all the files inside the **testnet_TR** to Turkish. I will not change the file names. Also, I will translate *README.md* and *SUMMARY.md* files and save it inside the **testnet_TR** folder.

# Expected Impact & Outcomes for the Voi Community 
1. **Language Diversity and Accessibility:** Translating the documentation into Turkish enhances accessibility for Turkish-speaking users, making it easier for them to engage with the network. This can potentially expand the user base.

2. **Community Contribution:** The translation effort can increase the number of Turkish-speaking contributors to the Voi Community. This fosters diversity within the community and encourages individuals with various skill sets to contribute to the network's development.

3. **Facilitating Turkish Node Operators:** Translations can simplify network usage and management for Turkish node operators, enabling them to contribute more effectively.

4. **Global Expansion and Adoption:** Multilingual documentation can contribute to the global expansion and adoption of Voi Network by encouraging more individuals to join.

5. **Community Collaboration:** Translation efforts promote collaboration and communication within the Voi Community by bridging language barriers.

# Technical Approach
As I mentioned in *Solution Approach* part, I will fork the **voi-docs** repository, make a folder name as **testnet_TR** and translate all the files inside it to Turkish.

# Define Success
Success will be measured based on the:

1. **Completion of Translation:** Success will be achieved when all selected documentation is fully translated into Turkish.

2. **Community Engagement:** Success will also be measured by the level of engagement and participation from the Turkish-speaking community. I aim to foster active involvement and feedback from community members throughout the translation process.

3. **Feedback and Iteration:** Success will entail a feedback loop where I actively seek input from the community and make necessary revisions to improve the quality of the translated documentation.

4. **Timely Delivery:** Adhering to the project timeline and delivering translations within the specified timeframe will be another indicator of success.

5. **Quality Assurance:** Success will be confirmed through a thorough quality assurance process to ensure that the translated content is accurate and effectively conveys the intended meaning.

# Concerns
1. **Incomplete or Unclear Documentation:** Some parts of the documentation are incomplete or not entirely clear. To address this concern, I will reach out to the Voi Network community and the original documentation maintainers for clarification. Additionally, I will use my best judgment and consult with subject matter experts within the community to fill in the gaps.

2. **Technical Jargon and Specific Terminology:** The documentation contains some technical jargon and specific terminology that can be challenging to translate accurately. I will establish a glossary of terms and maintain open communication with the community to ensure the use of consistent and appropriate terminology throughout the translation.

# Prerequisite

Collaborative efforts with the Voi Network community members and maintainers are crucial. Engaging with the community for feedback, clarification, and support will be a key part of the translation process. 

# Project Longevity 
In order to ensure the long-term success and sustainability of this project, I have a clear plan in place:

- **Initial Documentation Translation:** My primary focus is to translate the existing documentation into Turkish, as this is the immediate need for the Voi Network community. This will provide Turkish-speaking users with access to essential information and resources.

- **Ongoing Contributions:** Once the initial set of documentation is translated, I will continuously monitor the Voi Network's development and the addition of new documents to the 'voi-docs' repository.

- **Proposal for Additional Work:** If future documentation additions require substantial effort, and if the community and team are aligned with the idea, I will open a new proposal to continue translating these documents. This will ensure that the Turkish-speaking community has access to the latest information as the project evolves.

- **Commitment to Mainnet:** Regardless of the circumstances, I am committed to completing the translation of all documents in the 'voi-docs' repository into Turkish. This commitment extends until the project reaches the mainnet stage, ensuring that Turkish-speaking users have comprehensive and up-to-date documentation.

# Project Length
I estimate that I will be able to complete the first part of the project within 2 weeks. I am dedicated to allocating the necessary time and effort to ensure the project's successful completion. Any potential adjustments to the timeline will be communicated transparently and in collaboration with the community.
