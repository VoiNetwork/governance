# **SmartPoker Integration**
---

# Token Quantity
10 Voi TestNet Tokens

# Abstract
SmartPoker is a Poker platform currently integrated with the Algorand network,
with a desire to add support for the Voi network.
The platform utilizes smart contracts deployed to the blockchain,
which act as an escrow for player tokens.
SmartPoker needs a small number of tokens (10) to peform integration testing with Voi's testnet network.
Once integrated, players will be able to deposit Voi, use it to play ring and tournament style games,
and withdraw it back to their Voi wallets.

# Team 
Dave (xarmian) and Kevin (krunchy).
They have already successfully launched SmartPoker and the supporting contracts on the Algorand network.

DISCLAIMER: Dave (xarmian) is a current member of the Voi TestNet Governance Committee.

# Problem Description 
Tokens are needed to pay transaction fees on Voi's TestNet,
however in Voi's current early stages
TestNet tokens are not readily available.
This proposal is being submitted to request a small number of tokens to support the deployment of
the initial contracts and thoroughly test the integration of the contracts with SmartPoker's front- and back-end systems.

# Expected Impact & Outcomes for the Voi Community 
Applications integrated with the network will increase utilization (and therefore transactions) on the network,
which are necessary for the network to become sustainable.

# Define Success
The project will be considered successful once SmartPoker's integration with Voi has
feature parity with Algorand,
which includes being able to use one or more Voi wallets to authenticate, deposit, and withdraw tokens.

# Concerns
There are currently no concerns or expected complications, as SmartPoker currently supports Algorand
and has already launched a Voi TestNet token contract on the Voi network (application id 2225).

# Project Longevity 
The project is currently 100% self funded. As such, there are no guarantees of sustainability.

# Project Length
Less than two weeks from funding.
