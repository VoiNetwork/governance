# Problem Description 
There are currently not enough P2P asset exchanges on Voi that enable users to buy and sell NFTs and FTs.

# Solution Approach 
We will support and deploy [EXA Swap](https://swap.exa.market/) on Voi to attract and empower new users.

# Expected Impact & Outcomes for the Voi Community 
Our focus is to bring sustainable and innovative solutions to the Voi ecosystem.<br/>
We believe Voi could be the base layer for specific real world applications and we at EXA Labs think we can help accelerate this vision.

# Technical Approach
Here is how we will proceed:

**1. EXA Swap deployment on Voi**

*[EXA Swap](https://swap.exa.market/) is a trustless and permissionless p2p OTC NFT and FT trading tool.
It allows users to swap assets seamlessly and securely.* 

1. Supports appropriate assets
    1. NFTs 
        1. ASAs ([ARC-19](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0019), [ARC-69](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0069), and [ARC-3](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0003))
    2. FTs 
        1. ASAs
2. Ability for user to connect their wallet via [Browser Extension Wallet](https://github.com/VoiNetwork/governance/blob/main/Bounties/Browser%20Extension%20Wallet.md)
3. Views
    1. Home
        1. Sign In / Connect Wallet
        2. Create swap
    2. User profile
        1. Swaps activity
    3. Network Switch
        1. Testnet
        2. Mainnet
4. Link to assets on the [block explorer](https://github.com/VoiNetwork/governance/blob/main/Bounties/Block%20Explorer.md)
5. Deployed and working on
    1. Voi
        1. Testnet
        2. Mainnet 

# Define Success
Success will be measured based on the platform activity:
* Number of transactions
* Number of wallets
* Number of monthly active users
* Number of artists/creators
* Revenue generated

# Concerns
We do have some concerns regarding the current wallet support on Voi. [A-Wallet](https://a-wallet.net/) seems to be the only solution available which is good enough for development purpose but not suitable to onboard new users.


# Project Longevity 
Our team is 100% dedicated to the success of the project. We constantly thrive to find optimal product-market fit and above all being independent of the crypto market condition. In addition to that, we have enough funds in our treasury to maintaain and extend the project for the next year.

# Project Length
Q1 2024 | EXA Swap deployment on Voi Testnet<br/>
We do not have information about Voi Mainnet yet. As soon as it is out, EXA Swap will be deployed.
