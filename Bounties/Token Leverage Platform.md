# Token Leverage Platform

Testnet Token Bounty Size: **75MM to 125MM**

## Description

Voi needs alternate DEXs that provide services beyond just AMM swap pools. 

### What

We want to start with a DEX that can provide leveraged trading services via perpetual futures, margin trading, leveraged tokens or loans.

### Why

This is an important part of a thriving DeFi scene and will enable users of the network to attempt interesting strategies during the incentivized testnet.

## Problem Statement

There are currently no DEXs that provide leveraged trading services on Voi.

## Minimum Requirements

A web app for use on both testnet & mainnet of Voi.
