# Stateproof ASA Bridge

Testnet Token Bounty Size: **150MM to 250MM**

## Description

With the advent of state proofs on Algorand and Voi being the first other AVM that can utilise them we want to be able to show off the power of the AVM ecosystem by establishing the first decentralized bridge between Voi & Algorand.

### What

A decentralized bridge based on state proofs to connect fungible tokens on Algorand and Voi.

### Why

This is an important showcase not only of the capabilities of the AVM, but will enable users to bridge assets between Voi and Algorand in a decentralized and trustless way.

## Problem Statement

To create a decentralized state proof bridge between Voi and Algorand.

## Minimum Requirements

1. Bi-Directional Bridging
    1. Users are able to bridge tokens from Algorand to Voi
    2. Users are able to bridge tokens from Voi to Algorand
2. Support the appropriate standards on either side of the bridge
3. Network Switch
    1. Mainnet
    2. Testnet

## Definition of Done

- Successfully implemented the minimum features as per the minimum requirements
- 99.99% uptime for the duration of testnet
- All code open sourced
