# NFT Marketplace

Testnet Token Bounty Size: **75MM to 125MM**

## Description

Voi needs a NFT marketplace where producers and collectors are able to buy/sell NFTs via a web app.

### What

We need a web app marketplace that facilitates the exchanging of NFTs between users via different mechanisms. 

### Why

This is crucial for producers and collectors to be able to buy and sell non-fungible assets in a trustless way via smart contracts.
